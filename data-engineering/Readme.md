# 📚 Data Engineering Journey

Welcome to the **Data Engineering** branch of **TechStackDiary**! This branch is dedicated to my exploration of the world of data engineering, focusing on building scalable and efficient data pipelines, working with distributed systems, and mastering cloud-based data tools.

---

## 🚀 Objective

The main goal of this branch is to:
- Learn and apply key data engineering concepts and tools.
- Build hands-on projects and data pipelines that process large datasets efficiently.
- Gain expertise in cloud platforms, databases, and data processing frameworks.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

### Key Focus Areas:
- **Data Pipelines**: Apache Airflow, Apache NiFi
- **Big Data Processing**: Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kafka
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure
- **Databases**: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis)
- **Data Warehousing**: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery
- **Data Lakes**: AWS S3, HDFS
- **ETL Tools**: Talend, Apache Nifi
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## 🌐 Projects & Exercises

In this branch, I will document the following types of projects:
- **Data Pipelines**: Projects using Apache Airflow or custom-built solutions to manage workflows.
- **Big Data Processing**: Implementing distributed data processing with Apache Spark and Kafka.
- **Cloud-based Solutions**: Building and deploying data applications in the cloud (AWS/GCP).
- **ETL/ELT Solutions**: Developing scalable ETL workflows for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- **Data Warehousing**: Setting up and querying data warehouses using tools like Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery.

You can explore my progress and follow along with the projects!
