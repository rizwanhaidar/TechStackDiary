/**************************************Solution********************************/
SELECT DISTINCT NUM AS  ConsecutiveNums FROM LOGS L1 WHERE NUM IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT NUM FROM logs L2 WHERE l1.ID = L2.ID-1 AND
    NUM IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT NUM FROM logs L3 WHERE l2.ID = L3.ID-1
    )

);

/**************************Problem********************

Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |

| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
