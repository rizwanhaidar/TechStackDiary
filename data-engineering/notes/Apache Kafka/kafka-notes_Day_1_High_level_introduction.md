# Apache Kafka 101: Introduction

## What is an Event
An event represents something that has happened, combined with information about what has happened. It is a combination of **Notifications**.

### Examples of Events:
- Someone clicked on a link.
- A microservice completed its tasks.
- A business process change.

### Components of an Event:
1. **Notification**: The element that provides the *when-ness* of a thing.  
   (Can be used to trigger some other activity or activities.)
2. **State**:  
   - Small, usually less than a MB in size.  
   - Typically in a structured format (e.g., JSON, Avro).  
   - State is serialized in a commonly used standard format.

---

## Data Model of an Event
- **Key-Value Pair**:  
  Kafka internally is loosely typed, but the programming language used externally might enforce types.  
  The key-value pair concept in Kafka does not necessarily represent a unique identifier of an event but of some object or entity in Kafka.

# What is an Event

The definition of an event as something that has happened, combined with information about it, is accurate. Events in Kafka indeed capture changes or occurrences in the system (e.g., user actions or system events).

---

## Examples of Events

The examples provided (user clicking a link, microservice completing a task, business process changes) are appropriate and representative of events Kafka can handle.

---

## Components of an Event

### Notification
The concept of "when-ness" is a reasonable description of the temporal aspect of an event. Notifications can indeed trigger downstream actions in Kafka.

### State
Kafka events typically contain serialized data (e.g., JSON, Avro) that is compact and structured. The description here is accurate, especially regarding serialization in standard formats.

## Data Model of an Event

### Key-Value Pair
The explanation is accurate. Kafka itself is schema-less (loosely typed) and does not enforce strong typing internally. However, external programming environments interacting with Kafka (e.g., Java, Python) may enforce type constraints.

#### Clarification about the Key:
The key in Kafka is often used for partitioning purposes, not as a unique identifier for an event. Instead, it represents some logical entity (e.g., a user ID or order ID) associated with the event.
